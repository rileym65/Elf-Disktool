!addr byte byte ...
     Write a sequence of bytes into the sector edit buffer.

CD path
     This command will change the current working directory.  If path is
     preceeded by a leading / then the path is relative to the root directory
     otherwise if no leading / is present then the path is relative to the
     current directory.  the .. notation for one directory up is currently
     not supported.

CHAIN lump
     This command will show the lump numbers in the chain starting with lump
     'lump'.  lump is specified in hex.

COPY src dst
     This command will copy files between the host filesystem and the Elf/OS
     disk.  To distinguish a host file, enclose the name in square brackes.
     Example:
        COPY [data/zork1.dat] ZORK1.Z3
        Will copy the zork1.dat file located on the host filesystem to the
        current directory of the Elf/OS disk.
     Note: full pathnames are not yet supported for the Elf/OS disk, therefore
           you must use CD to change into the diretory you wish to copy 
           from/to.  Full pathnames are however supported in host filenames.

DELETE file
     This command will delete the specified file.

DIR
     Show the contents of the current directory.  It is not yet supported to
     list the contents of a directory other than the current directory.  The
     following switches may also be used:
          -L - Show starting lump of file
          -S - Show size of file

DUMP file
     Display the contents of a file as a hex dump

EXTRACT file
     This command will extract the kernel image from the Elf/OS disk and write
     it as a binary file on the host filesystem

FSGEN size
     Generate a blank file system on the Elf/OS disk.  size specifies how
     many sectors (in decimal) the resulting image will have.

HELP
     Show the available commands

MD dirname
     This command will create a new subdirectory underneath the current
     directory.  Full pathnames are not yet supported for this command.

PWD
     Print the name of the current working directory

RD dir
     This command will remove a directory from the current directory.  The
     directory can only be removed if it is empty.

RENAME old new
     This command will rename a file.  Since the new file is a rename of the
     old file, a directory path is invalid in the new name.  It is however
     allowed to have a full path for old.  The file will be renamed in the
     specified directory.  It is not moved while being renamed.

SECTOR num
     Display a hex dump of the specified sector.  'num' is specified in hex.
     The sector is also loaded into the sector edit buffer.

SHOWSEC
     Display the sector currently loaded into the sector edit buffer.

STAT
     Show the current statistics for the Elf/OS disk.

SYS file
     This command will take the specified binary file and install it as the
     kernel on the Elf/OS disk.

TYPE file
     This command will type out the ascii contents of the specified file.

WRSEC
     Write sector buffer back to disk.

QUIT
     This will quit the disktool.

Notes: Only the CD command can accept full pathnames.  All other file/directory
       arguments must be single names.

       All numbers requested from the user must be in hex.

       When disktool is started, it automatically opens disk1.ide for the 
       Elf/OS disk.  You can specify another disk device/file on the command
       line when starting disktool.

Planned Enhancements:
1.  Allow for full pathnames in all file/directory arguments.
2.  Allow for the .. syntax in directory paths
*** Allow copying where source and destination are on the Elf/OS disk
*** Allow for overwriting an existing file
*** Add a RENAME command
6.  Add a MOVE command
7.  Multiple disk support. This would facilitate transfering a file from one
    Elf/OS disk to another.
*** FSGEN - Ability to generate the Elf/OS filesystem on a new device.
*** SYS - Ability to copy a new kernel onto an Elf/OS disk.
*** SEDIT - Ability to directly edit disk sectors.
11. DSKCHK - Ability to scan the Elf/OS disk for allocation errors.
